A summer day is passing by, the setting sun is shining down on your face
Together we're hand in hand looking at the golden sky
How much I was waiting for this moment, it's been so many nights without you
Wishing only that it would last forever more

You are the only one to make my dreams come true, I never thought that it could be so real
Now I believe that it was meant to be cos I found you here by my side
Oh I wanna be the one to show your smile to the world, so that your loneliness would fade away
Whatever comes today I'll be there for you, let me give you happiness for tomorrow

For so many days you've been gone I know that you were going after your dreams
Although we were far away, always hoped your dreams would shine
Used to think about your smile every night as I cried myself to sleep and
My love for you is now stronger than ever before

You are the only one to make my dreams come true, I never thought that it could be so real
Now I believe that it was meant to be cos I found you here by my side
Oh I wanna be the one to show your smile to the world, so that your loneliness would fade away
Whatever comes today I'll be there for you, let me give you happiness for tomorrow

You are the only one to bring me joy in this world, I always wanna have you in my life
Now I believe that it was meant to be cos I found you here by my side
Oh I wanna be the one to give my heart to you, the sorrow that you have would melt away
Whatever comes today I'll be there for you, let me show you happiness for tomorrow
Whatever comes today I'll be there for you, let me show you happiness for tomorrow
